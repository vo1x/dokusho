# Dokusho - A Next.js Learning Project

This project is for me to learn and explore Next.js. It's a manga reader with AniList tracker support.

**Please be aware that the code is highly unstable and experimental.** It's not intended for production use and may contain numerous bugs and inefficiencies.

## Criticism Welcome!

I am actively seeking feedback and suggestions to improve my understanding of Next.js and best practices. If you have any comments, criticisms, or ideas for improvement, **please don't hesitate to share them!** Your input is highly valued and greatly appreciated.
